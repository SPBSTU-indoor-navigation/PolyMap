# UIScreenExtension

This is an extension to UIScreen that provides information about the pixel density (or point density) of iPhones and iPads. For example this can be used to:

* compute the dimension of the screen
* draw a ruler; or
* to show a proper ECG graph on the iPhone's screen.

      public extension UIScreen {
    
        /// The number of pixels per inch for this device
        public static let pixelsPerInch: CGFloat?
        
        /// The number of pixels per centimeter for this device
        public static let pixelsPerCentimeter: CGFloat?
        
        /// The number of points per inch for this device
        public static let pointsPerInch: CGFloat?
        
        /// The number of points per centimeter for this device
        public static let pointsPerCentimeter: CGFloat?
        
        /// The screen dimension in inches
        public static let dimensionInInches: CGSize?
        
        /// The screen dimension in centimeters
        public static let dimensionInCentimeters: CGSize?
      }

The constants will be set to `.none` if the device is unknown. This can happen if Apple releases a new iPhone, so please remember to deal with this in your code.


## Installation and use

The extension can be installed using Swift Package Manager or [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) by adding below line to your `Podfile`:

    pod 'UIScreenExtension', :git => 'https://github.com/marchv/UIScreenExtension'

To use the extension in your code first import it by adding:

    import UIScreenExtension
    
And then use it for example:

    if let pointsPerCentimeter = UIScreen.pointsPerCentimeter {
       // code
    }

Or to compute the diagonal screen dimension:

    if let dimensionInInches = UIScreen.dimensionInInches {
        print(sqrt(pow(dimensionInInches.width, 2) + pow(dimensionInInches.height, 2))) // for example ~5.5 inches for iPhone 7 Plus
    }


## Support

The extension supports all iPhones, iPods and iPads that are supported by iOS 9-14.


## Limitations

Please note that iPhone only apps upscaled on iPads will not work properly!


## Improvements

* Apple Watch support
* Objective C support
* Fetch information about new iPhone models from internet
